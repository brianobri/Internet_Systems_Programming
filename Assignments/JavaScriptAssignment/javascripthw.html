<!--Use functions, pattern matching and event handling in your scripts. Validation is done when the user clicks on a Validate button and by the blur event. (validation on submit click event and when leaving a field, 2  points)  -->
<!--If an error is found, then an alert message is produced and the input field that contains the invalid value(s) will change the border of the input field to color ‘red’.  The auto grader will look for the border color with the keyword of ‘red’.  If anything else is used, this will be marked incorrect, so please follow directions.  On the Validate button click show the alert.  It is not necessary to show the alert on the change event.  Be sure that only one alert message is shown with all of the validation errors.  Should not contain multiple alert messages. One and only 1 alert message on form validation errors. (2 points)   -->
