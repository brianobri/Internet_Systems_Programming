<!--Validation is done when the user clicks on a Submit button and by the change/blur event. If an error is found, the input field that contains the invalid value(s) will change the border of the input field to color ‘red’.  The auto grader will look for the border color with the keyword of ‘red’.  If anything else is used, this will be marked incorrect, so please follow directions.-->
